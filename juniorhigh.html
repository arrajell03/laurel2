		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There's so much that happened during my high school days, after graduating in elementary I went to a Catholic School named Colegio dela Inmaculada Concepcion Cebu. This school shaped me as a person. It taught me to feel the pain of those less fortunate, it taught me to give what I have and to put my self in someone else's shoes. Without this school. I wouldnt have known friendships too. The values and the heart of an inmaculadista will be with me. It helps me a lot to have a confidence due to the different stage performances and presentations that we had. There are so many events happened, since it was a Catholic School we pray rosary everyday and everytime there was a feast day of a saint, there will be a mass. There are so many talks and orientations in our school and after the orientation we will write a reflection to what have we learn in the talk. It helps us improved our active listening skills and writing skills. There are also Special Interest Clubs like chess, chorale, math club, etc. My club was dance club and we were able to perform during the Culminating Activity in our school. During grade ten we were supposed to perform our cheerdance but unfortunately we weren't able to perform it because of COVID-19 and our retreat and graduation was cancelled.</p>
