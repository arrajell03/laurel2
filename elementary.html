		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When I was in grade four after class at the school's grounds, me and my classmates will play any games like bahaw-bahaw, chinese garter, luksong baka, dakpanay, etc. I remember that whenever we had our examination our teacher would give 20 pesos to whoever had a passing score. For me grade five was the most memorable grade level because I had the best adviser and classmates. I can say that they're the best because they were jamming, fun and we help each other in terms of academics and other stuffs. I also had a good relationship with my adviser, we treat each other like mother and daughter. During that time our class won in our school's contest in 'Sabayang Pagbigkas' and also during the 'Playground Demonstration' and the whole grade five level won. We were so happy back then because our hard work and exposing ourselves to the sun to be able to practice, it all pays off. Grade six level was also a memorable one during elementary days of mine because some of my best friends during grade five was also my classmates in grade six and I was so happy. It's memorable because this is the last grade level in elementary so that we can proceed to high school. We don't know when we will meet again because after the graduation some of us transfer to different schools to study in high school but I know for sure that we do miss each other especially the bond we made, the chikas, the laughter that we shared together.</p>
