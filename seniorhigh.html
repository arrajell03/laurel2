		<h1>SENIOR HIGH DAYS</h1>
		<center> <img src="shsgradpic.jpg"> </center> 
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Studying as senior high school student was very new to me because of the new way of learning. Due to the pandemic we had a pure online class, us students experienced to study in a distance learning which means there is no face-to-face classes will be done but we weren't able to adopt and adjust to it quickly. I wasn't able to meet my classmates because we were forbidden to go out because there was an ECQ. All our presentations that are by group were planned and presented virtually. When I was in grade 12, in the midst of the pandemic on December 16, 2021, a horrific incident occurred: hundreds of people died during Typhoon Odette and it was the worst day of the people of Cebu. After the typhoon, my family was in a very hard situation, not just my family but also the people who were affected by the typhoon in different places in Cebu and outside Cebu. It was hard for us students because some of the modules and books are wet. There were no electricity, water and also there were buildings, posts and trees that were damage and scattered across the street, that is why the classes was not resumed. Fortunately, few months after the typhoon the classes continued and we were able to have our graduation pictorial, graduation rehearsal and finally the graduation ceremony. During these events and happenings, that was the only time I was able to meet my classmates personally.</p>
